## App Description

X-it-out is a simple JavaScript single-page application that helps users to manage their
daily chores and tasks. The user chooses his tasks priority. Based on them the user gains
or loses points. That stimulates him to accomplish his duties in time.By doing so he would
be more productive and better organized.
In order to be more helpful, we implemented some algorithms - sorting tasks either by
name or by due date, searching by name or selected date. We think that functionalities
would be in grant assistance for our users.

## Rules

As we already said the app contains points implementation. When the user creates a task he
selects its priority - *high*, *medium* or *low*. The points for each of them are as follows - 10,
5, and 2. If the user assumes that he completed his task, he should mark it as done. By doing
so he would be rewarder with points. If he assumes that he cannot complete the task, he should 
mark it as incompleted and points for this task will be subtracted from the total amount. 
The event of substraction will occur also if a task's deadline is not met.


| Priority | Points |
| -------- | ------ |
| low	   | 2	    |
| medium   | 5	    |
| height   | 10	    |
